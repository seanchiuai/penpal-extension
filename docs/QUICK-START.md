## Example Instructions to Try

### Style Changes
- "Make this more casual and friendly"
- "Rewrite in a professional tone"
- "Simplify the language for a 10-year-old"
- "Make it more persuasive"

### Grammar & Mechanics
- "Fix all grammar and spelling errors"
- "Improve the punctuation"
- "Fix run-on sentences"
- "Make verb tenses consistent"

### Content Changes
- "Add more details to each paragraph"
- "Make this more concise"
- "Remove redundant information"
- "Add examples to support the main points"

### Structure Changes
- "Break this into shorter paragraphs"
- "Add bullet points for the main ideas"
- "Reorganize for better flow"
- "Add section headers"

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load resources" Error
**Solution:** The extension is trying to fetch files that were blocked by network restrictions. This is expected - the core functionality still works.

### Sidebar Won't Open
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're on a Google Docs page (not Google Drive)
- Try refreshing the page
- Click the extension icon again

### "Please set your API key" Message
**Solution:**
- Click the ‚öôÔ∏è settings icon
- Enter your Anthropic API key
- Click Save

### No Text Extracted
**Solution:**
- Make sure there's actually text in your document
- Try typing some text first
- Refresh the Google Docs page

### API Error
**Solution:**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that your API key has credits
- Try a shorter instruction

## Current Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This is a proof-of-concept. The extension:

‚úÖ **DOES:**
- Extract text from Google Docs
- Process with Claude AI
- Compute differences
- Show suggestions in sidebar

‚ùå **DOES NOT (YET):**
- Create actual suggestions in Google Docs
- Preserve formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- Work with very large documents (>10k words)
- Handle tables, images, or complex layouts

The suggestions are computed and displayed in the sidebar, but not automatically applied to the document. To see the changes, you'll need to manually copy the new text.

## What You're Seeing

When you use the extension, here's what happens:

1. **Original Text** ‚Üí Extracted from your doc
2. **AI Processing** ‚Üí Claude rewrites according to instructions
3. **Diff Computation** ‚Üí Algorithm finds what changed
4. **Sidebar Display** ‚Üí Shows you:
   - üóëÔ∏è Red suggestions = Text to delete
   - ‚ûï Blue suggestions = Text to add
   - Summary of total changes

## Making It Production-Ready

To get suggestions actually appearing in the Google Doc (like TypeOS does), you'd need to:

1. Set up Google Cloud Project
2. Enable Google Docs API
3. Add OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Implement API integration
5. Use API to create suggestions

This requires additional setup beyond the scope of this demo.
